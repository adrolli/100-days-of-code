# Left Resources on the #100DaysOfCode

I am sorry for deleting mostly everything (I already know, read or find useless). Here's what's left:

- ["Meditations" by Marcus Aurelius](http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html)
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com)
- [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/) - huh, so many errors in the first few videos
- ["Eloquent Javascript" by Marijn Haverbeke](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
